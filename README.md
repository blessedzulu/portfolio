# portfolio

## :wave: Intro

This is versio 1 of my personal website. It is built from scratch using plain old HTML, CSS/SASS and JavaScript. The animations are powered by [https://greensock.com/gsap/](GSAP) and the transitions by [https://barba.js.org/](Barba.js).

## :pencil: Notes

I built this website after learning and becoming proficient in the fundamental frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). This approach pushed me to really understand what I was doing and to do it as well as I could. It was and continues to be a huge learning experience for me.

However, it's not without its drawbacks. The biggest being the lack of HTML code reuse. As such, this website would benefit largely from the use of a static site generator or a frontend library like React. The second iteration of this website will work on that.
